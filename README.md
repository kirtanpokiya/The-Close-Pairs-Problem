# The-Close-Pairs-Problem
For geographic data, identify nearby points within a threshold distance to interact with. Generate a list of close pairs and execute desired calculations between them.

This project involves processing point data stored in CSV files using Apache Spark. The input consists of CSV files containing point IDs, X coordinates, and Y coordinates separated by commas. The goal is to identify pairs of points that are within a specified threshold distance.

The provided dataset, contained in Assignment1Data.zip, consists of multiple CSV files to be loaded into the DBFS. Rather than loading each CSV file individually, Spark will read the directory containing all the CSV files in parallel.

The approach for identifying close pairs of points starts with a brute-force method, which involves comparing every pair of points. However, this approach is inefficient (O(n^2)) and not suitable for large datasets. Nonetheless, it can provide "ground truth" data for validating more complex, efficient solutions.

A more scalable solution involves space partitioning by overlaying a grid onto the problem space. Each point is assigned to a grid cell, computed by dividing the coordinates by the grid cell size. When identifying close pairs, only points within the same cell and neighboring cells need to be considered, significantly reducing the number of comparisons.

To implement this efficiently in a parallel environment like Spark, a "pre-push" strategy is employed, where neighboring points are copied into adjacent cells during grid construction. This eliminates the need for repeated data shuffling across the network during distance calculations.

Duplicate pairs are avoided by carefully managing point duplication across cells and ensuring unordered pairs are treated equally.

The implementation should use RDDs exclusively, with no DataFrames. Points from CSV files should be transformed into tuple representations, including their grid cell locations. The grid cell size and threshold distance should be adjustable variables passed to relevant functions.

Once all points are organized into RDDs based on grid cells, distance calculations can be performed to identify close pairs.

It's recommended to utilize the "persist" method to avoid unnecessary recomputation of RDDs, but only for RDDs used multiple times. Single-use RDDs should not be persisted.

This project focuses on the generic structure of handling such problems efficiently in a distributed computing environment, rather than performing specific calculations on identified close pairs.
